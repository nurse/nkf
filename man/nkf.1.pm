nkf - Network Kanji Filter


=head1 SYNOPSIS


nkf B<[-butjnesliohrTVvwWJESZxXFfmMBOcdILg]> B<[>I<file ...>B<]>


=head1 DESCRIPTION


B<Nkf> is a yet another kanji code converter among networks, hosts and terminals.
It converts input kanji code to designated kanji code
such as ISO-2022-JP, Shift_JIS, EUC-JP, UTF-8, UTF-16 or UTF-32.

One of the most unique faculty of B<nkf> is the guess of the input kanji encodings.
It currently recognizes ISO-2022-JP, Shift_JIS, EUC-JP, UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32.
So users needn't set the input kanji code explicitly.

By default, X0201 kana is converted into X0208 kana.
For X0201 kana, SO/SI, SSO and ESC-(-I methods are supported.
For automatic code detection, nkf assumes no X0201 kana in Shift_JIS.
To accept X0201 in Shift_JIS, use B<-X>, B<-x> or B<-S>.

multiple options are specified as seprate strings, such as

  print nkf('--ic=UTF8-MAC', '-w', $string), "\n";

except the last arguments.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<-J -S -E -W -W16 -W32 -j -s -e -w -w16 -w32>

cf. --ic and --oc.

=over

=item B<-J>

ISO-2022-JP (JIS code).

=item B<-S>

Shift_JIS and JIS X 0201 kana.
EUC-JP is recognized as X0201 kana. Without B<-x> flag,
JIS X 0201 Katakana (a.k.a.halfwidth kana) is converted into JIS X 0208.
If you use Windows, see Windows-31J (CP932).

=item B<-E>

=item B<-f[I<m> [- I<n>]]>

Folding on I<m> length with I<n> margin in a line.
Without this option, fold length is 60 and fold margin is 10.

=item B<-F>

New line preserving line folding.

=item B<-Z[0-3]>

Convert X0208 alphabet (Fullwidth Alphabets) to ASCII.

=over

=item B<-Z -Z0>

Convert X0208 alphabet to ASCII.

=item B<-Z1>

Convert X0208 kankaku to single ASCII space.

=item B<-Z2>

Convert X0208 kankaku to double ASCII spaces.

=item B<-Z3>

Replacing fullwidth >, <, ", & into '&gt;', '&lt;', '&quot;', '&amp;' as in HTML.

=back

=item B<-X -x>

With B<-X> or without this option, X0201 is converted into X0208 Kana.
With B<-x>, try to preserve X0208 kana and do not convert X0201 kana to X0208.
In JIS output, ESC-(-I is used. In EUC output, SS2 is used.

=item B<-B[0-2]>

Assume broken JIS-Kanji input, which lost ESC.
Useful when your site is using old B-News Nihongo patch.

=over

=item B<-B1>

allows any chars after ESC-( or ESC-$.

=item B<-B2>

force ASCII after NL.

=back

=item B<-I>

Replacing non iso-2022-jp char into a geta character
(substitute character in Japanese).

=item B<-m[BQN0]>

MIME ISO-2022-JP/ISO8859-1 decode. (DEFAULT)
To see ISO8859-1 (Latin-1) -l is necessary.

=over

=item B<-mB>

Decode MIME base64 encoded stream. Remove header or other part before
conversion. 

=item B<-mQ>

Decode MIME quoted stream. '_' in quoted stream is converted to space.

=item B<-mN>

Non-strict decoding.
It allows line break in the middle of the base64 encoding.

=item B<-m0>

No MIME decode.

=back

=item B<-M>

MIME encode. Header style. All ASCII code and control characters are intact.

=over

=item B<-MB>

MIME encode Base64 stream.
Kanji conversion is performed before encoding, so this cannot be used as a picture encoder.

Perform quoted encoding.

=back

=item B<-l>

Input and output code is ISO8859-1 (Latin-1) and ISO-2022-JP.
